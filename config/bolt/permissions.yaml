# This file defines role-based access control for your Bolt site.
# Before making any modifications to this file, make sure you've thoroughly
# read the documentation at https://docs.bolt.cm/configuration/permissions
# and understand the consequences of making uninformed changes to the roles and
# permissions.

# List of roles that are presented in the list of options when editing a user.
# Roles that are not in this list are left 'as is' when editing users.
# Note: ROLE_USER is assigned to Bolt Entity Users if no roles have been set.
assignable_roles: [ROLE_DEVELOPER, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR, ROLE_EDITOR, ROLE_USER, ROLE_WEBSERVICE]

# These permissions are the 'global' permissions; these are not tied
# to any content types. Most of them apply to global, non-content activity 
# in Bolt's backend but there are exceptions like the api:* permissions
# used to manage access to the api-platform based requests.
# Most of these permissions map directly to backend routes;
# keep in mind, however, that routes do not always correspond to URL paths 1:1.
# The default set defined here is appropriate for most sites, so most likely,
# you will not have to change it.
# Also note that the 'editcontent' and 'overview' routes are special-cased
# inside the code, so they don't appear here.

# For content type related actions, permissions can be set individually for
# each content type. For this, we define three groups of permission sets.
# The 'contenttype-base' permission sets *overrides*; any roles specified here
# will grant a permission for all content types, regardless of the rest of this
# section.
# The 'contenttype-default' contains rules that are used when the desired
# content type does not define a rule for this permission itself.
# The 'contenttypes' section specifies permissions for individual content
# types.
#
# To understand how this works, it may be best to follow the permission checker
# through its decision-making process.
#
# First it checks whether any of the current user's roles match any of the
# roles in contenttype-base/{permission}. If so, the search is over, and the
# permission can be granted.
#
# The next step is to find contenttypes/{contenttype}/{permission}. If it is
# found, then the permission can be granted if and only if any of the user's
# roles match any role in contenttypes/{contenttype}/{permission}.
#
# If either contenttypes/{contenttype} or
# contenttypes/{contenttype}/{permission} is absent, the permission checker
# uses contenttype-default/{permission} instead. If any role exists in both the
# user's roles and contenttype-default/{permission}, the permission can be
# granted.
#
# Note especially that an *empty* set of roles in the contenttype section means
# something else than the *absence* of the permission. If the permission is
# defined with an empty role list, it overrides the role list in
# contenttype-default; but if the permission is not mentioned, the
# corresponding entry in contenttype-default applies.
#
# The following permissions are available on a per-contenttype basis:
#
# - edit: allows updating existing records
# - create: allows creating new records
# - change-status: allows changing the published status of a record
# - delete: allows (hard) deletion of records
# - change-ownership: allows changing a record's owner. Note that ownership may
#                     grant additional permissions on a record, so this
#                     permission can indirectly enable users more permissions
#                     in ways that may not be immediately obvious.
# - view: allows viewing records in the backend (listings, content/fields)
#
# Note that all permissions imply 'view' permission, so you don't have to give 'view' along with 'edit'
# Note change-ownership is available as a setting but is not implemented in the bolt admin at the moment

# these permissions will be set for all contenttypes, config below can add additional roles to these, but they can not be overridden
contenttype-base:
    edit: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
    create: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
    change-status: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ] # Note: You can have 'change-status' permission without 'edit' but you cannot use that at the moment as there is no screen that only handles status changes
    delete: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
    change-ownership: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
    view: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ] # = show in menu, show listings, open 'edit' view without actually being able to edit, any of the other permissions always imply 'view'

# these permissions are used as a default for contenttypes, they are added to the base permissions
# you can override these settings per contenttype by adding it to the `contenttypes:` array
contenttype-default:
    edit: [ ROLE_EDITOR, CONTENT_OWNER ]
    create: [ ROLE_EDITOR ]
    change-ownership: [ CONTENT_OWNER ] # <-- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET (and: how to handle chance-ownership permission without 'edit'?)

contenttypes:

# This is an example of how to define Contenttype specific permissions
#
# contenttypes:
#    # Keys in this dictionary map to keys in the contenttypes.yml specification.
#    showcases:
#        # Rules defined here *override* rules defined in contenttype-default,
#        # but *add* to rules in contenttype-base. This means that permissions
#        # granted through contenttype-base cannot be revoked here, merely
#        # amended.
#
#        # Only the Admin and Chief Editor are allowed to edit records
#        edit: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
#        create: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
#        change-status: [ ROLE_CHIEF_EDITOR ]
